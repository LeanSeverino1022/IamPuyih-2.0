        <p> Product customization allows customers to customize products and see a live preview of their customization for a better buying experience. I've done a number of product-customization projects(living room, Kitchen, clothing, etc.) including the one in the video. My job also includes communicating with the artists and the the CEO to produce desired output.</p>
    
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I worked only on the functionality and ALL of the product assets were provided to me by the company.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- <p>I'll publish my own sample live app with functionality anyone can play with once I can provide my own product assets </p> -->
