Incomplete notes of stuff related to how this was made. I update this once in a while so this is a guide for me to get an overview.

### Intro Particle effect 

- Used particle.js
- I customized the configuration json file to create the particle effect the I want. You can also use the default configuration on Github.
- Check out the library documentation. It lists many of the options that are available. You can customize the size, interactivity, speed and much more.



### Portfolio gallery section inspired by https://caferati.me/portfolio



### Sphere animtation showing the Skills

- Inspired by https://jacekjeznach.com/
- used The library TagCanvas
- Installation instructions: https://www.goat1000.com/tagcanvas-install.php
- TagCanvas cloud can either be using using their stand-alone or jQuery plugin version. I'm using the jQuery plugin. Convert to the standalone later on when I can remove all jQuery dependencies.
