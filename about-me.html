                  <h2>Why I love coding&nbsp;üíª</h2>
                  <p>
                     The sheer joy of making things. I created my first game using
                     Visual Basic at the age of 14, at school. I remember I was just so
                     happy that I felt SUPER because I can create these mini games and
                     people ask for your help. From that moment, I knew that coding was
                     for me. In my career, even though I experienced some setbacks
                     along the way, I still have this hunger to be great at
                     programming. I really enjoy the process of learning fundamentals
                     and concepts, especially about Javascript. I understand coding is
                     hard at times, but it's very rewarding to realize how much you've
                     grown your personal and technical skills after years of ups and
                     downs. To be able to help your clients bring their ideas to life
                     and get paid doing it is awesome. Also, It's difficult for a lot
                     of people to earn a good living in my country. I always had big
                     dreams on how to help a lot of people and I know coding will be
                     key for me to be able to do that.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Professional expertise&nbsp;üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
                  <p>
                     I've worked for different clients from different parts of the
                     world. I can effectively communicate using the English language
                     and different tools. I have strong fundamental skills in HTML,
                     CSS, and Javascript(my favorite) which allows me to learn and
                     adapt fast to the constantly changing technology. I can show & prove
                     that I am trustworthy, gritty, and resourceful enough to get the
                     job done.
                  </p>

                  <h2>When I'm not coding&nbsp;üåÑ</h2>
                  <p>
                     At home, I just watch movies, read a book, or listen to
                     podcasts. When outdoors before Coronavirus üò∑, I would play
                     basketball 1x-2x a week. I love going to the mountains or just
                     some place where its peaceful - where I can just have fun
                     conversations with people. When I work, I work hard, but when it's
                     time to relax and enjoy, I try not to waste the opportunity.
