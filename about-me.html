            <h2>When I'm not coding üåÑ</h2>
            <p>
              At home, I usually just watch movies, read a book, or listen to
              podcasts. When outdoors before Coronavirus üò∑, I usually play
              basketball 1x-2x a week. I love going to the mountains or just
              some place where its peaceful - where I can just have fun
              conversations with people. When I work, I work hard but when it's
              time to relax and enjoy, I try not to waste the opportunity.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I love coding üíª</h2>
            <p>
              The sheer joy of making things. I created my first game using
              Visual Basic at the age of 14, at school. I remember I was just so
              happy that I felt SUPER because I can create these mini games and
              people ask for your help. From that moment, I knew that coding was
              for me. In my career, even though I experienced some setbacks
              along the way, I still have these hunger to be great at
              programming. I really enjoy the process of learning fundamentals
              and concepts, especially about Javascript. I understand coding is
              hard at times but it's very rewarding to realize how much you've
              grown your personal and technical skills after years of ups and
              downs. To be able to help your clients bring their ideas to life
              and get paid doing it is awesome. Also, It's difficult for a lot
              of people to earn a good living in my country. I always had big
              dreams on how to help a lot of people and I know coding will be
              key for me to be able to do that.
            </p>

            <h2>Professional expertise üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>
              I've worked for different clients from different parts of the
              world. I can effectively communicate using the English language
              and different tools. I have strong fundamental skills in HTML,
              CSS, and Javascript(my favorite) which allows me to learn and
              adapt fast to the constant changing technology. I can show & prove
              that I am trustworthy, gritty, and resourceful enough to get the
              job done.
