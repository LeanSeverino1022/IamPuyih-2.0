               <h2>Hi!</h2>
               <p> My name is Leandro, but my friends and family call me Puyih.<br> I was born and raised in the Philippines.</p>
               <!-- <p>II was born and raised in Negros Occidenta Philippines.</p> -->       
            
               <h2>Me outside of work.</h2>
               <p>When I'm not online, I usually get out of my house and play basketball, go to the movies, read a book, go to the mountains and relax, or just have fun conversations with my girlfriend and/or friends. When I work, I focus hard and when it's time to relax and enjoy, I try not to waste the opportunity. </p>
               <h2>
               Why coding?</h2>
               <p>Coding is my passion, I want to be great. Programming is hard but it's easy for me to fail, strive, be patient, and keep on going.  It's just a game for me, it's just that the end game of it is just much longer than in a video game. You'll have to work on your skills and game plan so you can succeed in the end. I also dream of helping a lot of people. It's difficult to live & get paid enough in our country and it's hard to think that almost everyone's goal is to work abroad. I've got ambitous goals to help more and I know coding will be key to getting me there soon.</p>
               <h2>
               Why me?</h2>
               <p>I've worked for different clients from different parts of the world. I  can effectively communicate using the English language and different tools. I have strong fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript(my favorite) which allows me to learn and adapt fast to the constant changing technology. I can show & prove that I am trustworthy, gritty, and resourceful enough to get the job done. </p>
