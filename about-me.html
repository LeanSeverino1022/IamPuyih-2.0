                  <p> Hi, my name is <br><span class="big-text">Leandro, a front-end developer </span>with  7+ years of professional experience in coding. I help individuals and businesses solve a problem, grow an existing project, or bring their ideas to life. I have worked remotely with companies from the US, Canada, and Netherlands. </p>

                  <h2>When I'm not coding üåÑ</h2>
                  <p>

                     When at home, I usually just watch movies, read a book, or listen to podcasts. When outdoors before Coronavirus üò∑, I usually play basketball 1x-2x a week. I love going to the mountains or just some place where its peaceful -  where I can just have fun
                     conversations with people. When I work, I work hard but
                     when it's time to relax and enjoy, I try not to waste the opportunity.

                  </p>

                  <h2>Why I love coding üíª</h2>
                  <p>
                     Coding is my passion and I want to be great at it. Programming is hard but it's easy
                     for me to fail, strive, be patient, and keep on going. I like to relate it to  a game where you'll have to work on your skills and game plan so you can succeed in the end. I also dream of helping a lot of people. It's difficult for a lot of people to earn a good living in my country, the Philippines and I've got ambitous goals to be able to help lots of people - and I know coding will
                     be key for me to be able to do that.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Professional expertise üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
                  <p>
                     I've worked for different clients from different parts of the world. I can
                     effectively communicate using the English language and different tools. I have
                     strong fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript(my favorite) which
                     allows me to learn and adapt fast to the constant changing technology. I can
                     show & prove that I am trustworthy, gritty, and resourceful enough to get the
                     job done.
                  </p>
